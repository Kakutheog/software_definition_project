##### Code Examples

###### Example Prompt for AI-Powered Code Generation

Plaintext

```plaintext
Generate a Python function that retrieves data from a SQLite database and displays it in a tabular format using Pandas.
```

**Expected AI Response:**

Python

```python
import pandas as pd
import sqlite3

def retrieve_data():
    conn = sqlite3.connect('database.db')
    df = pd.read_sql_query("SELECT * FROM data_table", conn)
    return df

df = retrieve_data()
print(df)
```

###### Example Prompt for File and Folder Management

Plaintext

```plaintext
Create a function that creates a new directory named 'project_data' and saves a file named 'config.json' inside it with the following content: {"name": "Personal Home Service Management", "version": "1.0.0"}.
```

**Expected AI Response:**

Python

```python
import os
import json

def create_directory_and_file():
    directory = 'project_data'
    if not os.path.exists(directory):
        os.makedirs(directory)
    
    config = {"name": "Personal Home Service Management", "version": "1.0.0"}
    with open(os.path.join(directory, 'config.json'), 'w') as f:
        json.dump(config, f, indent=4)

create_directory_and_file()
```
