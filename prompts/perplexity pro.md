    Provide commands for creating a Python virtual environment and initializing a Node.js project."

## 2. Software Requirements and Architecture

"Define the requirements and architecture for a Personal Home Service Management Software:

- Core features: service scheduling, task management, user authentication, notifications, reporting
- User interface: AI chat interface, multi-tab interface (code generation, file explorer, software preview)
- Backend: RESTful API, database integration
- Integration with open-source services and APIs  
    Provide a high-level architecture diagram and explain the relationships between components."

## 3. User Interface Design

"Create wireframes or mockups for the Personal Home Service Management Software using open-source design tools. Include designs for:

- Login/Registration screen
- Dashboard
- Service scheduling interface
- Task management interface
- Settings and profile management
- AI chat interface
- Multi-tab interface (code generation, file explorer, software preview)  
    Suggest appropriate React component libraries and explain how to implement responsive design."

## 4. Backend Development

"Develop the backend API for the Personal Home Service Management Software using Flask or Django. Include endpoints for:

- Service scheduling and management
- Task creation, updating, and deletion
- Notification system
- Reporting and analytics  
    Provide sample code for implementing JWT-based authentication and database integration using SQLAlchemy or Django ORM."

## 5. Frontend Development

"Implement the frontend for the Personal Home Service Management Software using React. Create components for:

- AI chat interface
- Multi-tab interface (code generation, file explorer, software preview)
- Service scheduling form
- Task management list
- User profile and settings  
    Demonstrate how to use React Router for navigation and Redux or Context API for state management."

## 6. AI Integration

"Integrate AI capabilities into the Personal Home Service Management Software:

- Implement natural language processing for the AI chat interface using Hugging Face Transformers
- Set up an AI code generation system using GitHub Copilot or OpenAI Codex
- Create prompts for generating code snippets related to service scheduling and task management  
    Provide example code for processing user queries and generating responses using the chosen AI models."

## 7. Open-Source Integration

"Integrate free and open-source services, APIs, and libraries into the Personal Home Service Management Software:

- GitHub API for version control and project management
- Calendar API (e.g., Google Calendar) for scheduling
- Open-source databases (e.g., PostgreSQL, SQLite)
- Machine learning libraries (e.g., scikit-learn) for analytics and recommendations  
    Demonstrate how to authenticate and make API calls to these services securely."

## 8. Testing and Debugging

"Implement a comprehensive testing strategy for the Personal Home Service Management Software:

- Unit tests for backend API endpoints
- Integration tests for database operations
- Frontend component testing using Jest and React Testing Library
- End-to-end testing using Cypress or Selenium  
    Provide example test cases and explain how to set up a continuous integration pipeline using GitHub Actions."

## 9. Deployment and Distribution

"Prepare the Personal Home Service Management Software for deployment:

- Create a production build of the React frontend
- Set up a production-ready backend server using Gunicorn or uWSGI
- Configure environment variables for sensitive information
- Implement logging and error handling  
    Explain how to package the application as a desktop app using Electron and distribute it for Windows 11."

## 10. Documentation and Maintenance

"Generate comprehensive documentation for the Personal Home Service Management Software:

- API documentation using Swagger or ReDoc
- User manual explaining software features and usage
- Developer guide for future maintenance and enhancements  
    Implement a system for collecting user feedback and bug reports, and outline a process for regular updates and feature additions."
