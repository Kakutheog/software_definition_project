### Step-by-Step Prompt Guide for Developing a Personal Home Service Management Application

#### Step 1: Initial Setup and Environment Configuration

**Prompt:**

```
AI, set up a new Windows 11 compatible project using Electron for a Personal Home Service Management application. Include dependencies for React for the frontend and Node.js for the backend. Initialize a Git repository and create a README.md with a basic project description.
```

**Expected AI Response:**

```
- Project setup complete with Electron, React, and Node.js.
- Initialized Git repository and created README.md with project description.
```

#### Step 2: AI Chat Interface Development

**Prompt:**

```
AI, develop a basic AI chat interface using React components. Integrate the Hugging Face Transformers library to handle natural language processing. Provide a simple text input and display area for responses.
```

**Expected AI Response:**

```
Code for a basic AI chat interface using React and Hugging Face Transformers. Includes components for TextInput and ChatDisplay.
```

#### Step 3: Multi-Tab Interface Setup

**Prompt:**

```
AI, create a multi-tab interface in the Electron application. Tabs should include 'Code Generation', 'File Explorer', and 'Software Preview'. Use React Router for navigation between tabs.
```

**Expected AI Response:**

```
Code for setting up a multi-tab interface using React Router, including placeholders for each specified tab.
```

#### Step 4: AI-Powered Code Generation Feature

**Prompt:**

```
AI, implement an AI-powered code generation feature in the 'Code Generation' tab. Use OpenAI's Codex model to generate code based on user prompts. Include syntax highlighting using Monaco Editor.
```

**Expected AI Response:**

```
Code for integrating OpenAI Codex with a code editor using Monaco Editor for syntax highlighting. Includes functions to handle user prompts and display generated code.
```

#### Step 5: File and Folder Management

**Prompt:**

```
AI, add functionality in the 'File Explorer' tab to manage files and folders using Node.js fs module. Users should be able to create, delete, and modify files and folders within their project directory.
```

**Expected AI Response:**

```
Node.js code using the fs module to manage file system operations such as create, delete, and modify files and folders.
```

#### Step 6: GitHub Integration

**Prompt:**

```
AI, integrate GitHub functionality using the simple-git library. Allow users to fetch code snippets, clone repositories, commit changes, and push updates from within the application.
```

**Expected AI Response:**

```
Code using simple-git to handle GitHub operations directly from the application. Includes functions for cloning, committing, and pushing to repositories.
```

#### Step 7: Testing and Debugging

**Prompt:**

```
AI, generate unit tests for the AI chat interface and the file management features using Jest. Identify any potential bugs or issues in the code.
```

**Expected AI Response:**

```
Jest unit tests for the AI chat interface and file management features. Includes test cases and mocks for external dependencies.
```

#### Step 8: Deployment Considerations

**Prompt:**

```
AI, provide a guide for packaging and deploying the Electron application on Windows 11. Ensure the application is optimized for performance and security.
```

**Expected AI Response:**

```
Step-by-step guide on packaging the Electron application using electron-packager. Includes tips on performance optimization and security best practices.
```

#### Step 9: User Experience (UX) Design

**Prompt:**

```
AI, suggest improvements for the UI/UX design of the application. Focus on accessibility, responsiveness, and user interaction elements.
```

**Expected AI Response:**

```
Suggestions for UI/UX improvements including accessibility features, responsive design practices, and interactive elements like tooltips and modal dialogs.
```

#### Step 10: Final Review and Adjustments

**Prompt:**

```
AI, conduct a final review of the entire project. Suggest any refinements or additional features that could enhance the application's functionality or user experience.
```

**Expected AI Response:**

```
Comprehensive review with suggestions for refinements and additional features such as integration with additional APIs, enhanced security features, or user customization options.
