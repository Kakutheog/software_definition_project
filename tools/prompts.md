Let's collaborate on a comprehensive, step-by-step prompt guide for developing a software using an AI coding tool.  We'll take our time to ensure clarity and completeness.
This guide will focus on using effective prompts to guide an AI in creating software with specific features we'll define together.  My development environment is Windows 11.  The software is for personal home service management and won't be used commercially.

Crucially, the software should leverage free and open-source tools, libraries, and APIs. We can achieve this by:

* Providing the AI with a list of relevant APIs and libraries, including their documentation.
* Enabling the AI to access and search online repositories like GitHub for suitable open-source code and libraries.
